        <h2>About Choco Lava Cake </h2>
        <p>Molten chocolate cake is a popular dessert that combines the elements of a chocolate cake and a souffl√©. Its name derives from the dessert's liquid chocolate center, and it is also known as chocolate moelleux (from French for "soft"), chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake. It should not be confused with chocolate fondant, a recipe that contains little flour, but much chocolate and butter, hence melting on the palate (but not on the plate). It is a type of self-saucing pudding.</p>
