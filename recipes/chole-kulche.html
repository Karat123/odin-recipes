        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                            <li>Soak the matar or dried white peas overnight or for 7 to 8 hours.
                            <li>Drain and pressure cook in 3 to 4 cups of water till the matar is completely cooked.
                            <li>If there is extra water and the mixture is thin, then simmer till the matar achieves a medium consistency.
                            <li> Mash the matar slightly with a wooden spoon.</li>
                            <li>The soaked matar can also be cooked in a pan, but it will take a lot of time.</li>
                            <li>In a pan, heat oil. On low heat, first brown the cumin seeds.
                                <li>Remove the pan from heat.
                                    <li>Then, add the dry spice powders one by one - chaat masala, roasted cumin powder, amchur powder, red chili powder and garam masala powder.
                                        <li>Stir and immediately pour this mixture into the cooked matar or add the cooked matar to this mixture.
                                            <li>Switch on the heat and let the matar get heated through for 3 to 4 minutes.
                                                <li>Now, add the prepared jaljeera chutney and stir.
                                                    <li>If the matar mixture looks dry, add some water.
                                                        <li>Cook the matar or peas curry till all the flavors get mingled, for about 2 to 3 minutes.
                                                            <li>Check the seasoning and add more black salt if required.
                                                                <li>You can make this and keep it aside till you prepare the kulchas. While serving, reheat the matar curry.
                                                                    <li>Top the matar curry with onions, tomato, ginger, chilies and coriander leaves. Squeeze some lemon juice on top and mix lightly.
                                                                        <li>Serve Matar Kulcha in bowls or plates.</li>
